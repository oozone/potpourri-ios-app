# Potpourri iOS app

#### Student: Matthias Vanooteghem
iOS app for Native Apps iOS HoGent

This is an iOS-app I made for the course Native Apps iOS at HoGent.

In the Potpourri app you can
- Get the current real-time price for selected cryptocoins (Flash, BTD, ...) and see a cool chart
- Get the current real-time price of bitcoin in various currencies (EUR, USD, ...) 
- Play some radio!
- Calculate the distance from your current position to the HoGent campus

Made by **Matthias Vanooteghem** for Hogeschool Gent 2017-2018.
